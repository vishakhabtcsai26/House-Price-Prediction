# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts house prices based on features like number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and house size (sqft). The project uses **Python**, **pandas**, and **scikit-learn** for building a machine learning model.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Train-test split
- Model training using Random Forest Regressor
- Evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score
- Predict price for new houses

## Dataset

The dataset (`house_data.csv`) contains sample data with the following columns:

- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Size(sqft)
- Price

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
